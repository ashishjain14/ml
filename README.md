Exploratory data analysis is basically to analyse the data, aggregate the findings and present it to stakeholders. If the findings are convincing enough then the next step would be to develop a model around the data etc. Exploratory data analysis involves the following steps:

1. Data Cleaning - Here we may have to perform Null value analysis and apply mean, mode and median. For numerical data we have to use mean, median and for categorical variable we have to use mode. Post null value imputation we have to check the data for invalid data and check for outliers.
2. Data Analysis - For categorical variables we can use univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis. For numerical values, with one attribute we can get some summary analysis and for more than one attribute we can run correlation analysis between attributes.
3. Derived Metrics - Create new columns for example Age as age is a continuous variable hence it is difficult to figure out any details so better to create bins for example 0-20, 21-40 and so on.
